Dude, just finished Demon City, and I gotta say, wow, what a ride. Seriously, that   is a trip, and not always in a good way, you know what I mean? Felt like an acid dream at 3 AM combined with my worst hangover. I mean, the animation's got its charm—vintage vibes and all—but some parts just melt your brain. Like, who thought giving demons polygons was a good idea?

Crazy, though, right? The plot's all over the place. Like, you try to follow the story, and then bam! It changes gears, and you’re left wondering if you missed a major scene or something. Just makes you think, did anyone actually edit this thing before sending it out? I had to pause and rewind like three times just to figure out who the hell was talking.

> And the characters, oh boy, they're not much help either. Some lines had me literally LOL-ing, not because they were funny, but because they made zero sense. Maybe my brain was just being slow, but 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   they said, it'd be fun they said.

But man, I gotta admit, there's something endearing about it—maybe it was the nostalgia. Takes me back to those sleepless nights where you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a group of friends, pizza boxes everywhere, and everyone's half-confused but fully entertained. It’s the quintessential so-bad-it's-good experience.

Also, did someone say exposition dump? Holy moly, they just kept throwing plot points like confetti. Like, stop, I'm not a sponge, I can't absorb all this crap simultaneously! Anyway, I guess the dude fighting through a neon demon underworld was kinda epic on its own, if you're into that.

for(int i = 0; i < demonCount; i++) { slay(demons[i]); }

But whatever, I need to crash now. Brain's turning to mush, and I can't process any more demon antics or plot twists. Til our next wild ride through something equally mind-bending and disjointed, yeah? Catch you later.
